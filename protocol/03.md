Minimal setup for allowing payments on LAN networks.

## POST /
The Server MUST take a http `POST` request containing a valid [Payment](#payment) event in the request body.

If the TollGate accepts the provided payment it MUST return http `200 OK` response where the body is a `kind=21022` TollGate Session event.

If the payment is invalid, it MAY return a http `402 Payment Required` status.

## GET /
A `GET` request on the root endpoint MAY return http `200 OK` response where the  body is a `kind=21021` TollGate Discovery event.
