# FAQ generated from conversation about TollGate
## What is TollGate?

TollGate is an open-source project that enables anyone to become a permission-less internet service provider by reselling their internet connection for Bitcoin through WiFi.

## How does it work?

- Users can buy internet access for as little as 1 SAT without requiring:
  - SIM cards
  - Identity verification (KYC)
  - Contracts
- TollGate operators can resell their internet connection at a markup
- Multiple operators can compete in the same area, creating a competitive market
- Supports using different internet sources simultaneously for increased speed

## What are the key benefits?

- Permission-less internet access without identity requirements
- Pay-as-you-go model with minimal amounts (1 SAT)
- Potential cost savings through shared connections
- Ability to earn Bitcoin by reselling internet access
- Increased censorship resistance
- Enhanced privacy through e-cash support

## What are some potential use cases?

- Neighbourhood internet sharing
  - Example: 10 apartments sharing a Starlink connection
  - Cost savings for users
  - Income generation for operators
- Node runners providing anonymous internet access
- Dense urban areas with multiple competing operators
- Areas needing censorship-resistant internet access

## What about privacy and security?

- Supports e-cash for enhanced privacy
- Recommended to use VPN for additional security
- Data should be encrypted before leaving devices
- Users can run their own VPN on their TollGate
- Separate hardware is recommended for high-value devices (like Lightning nodes)

## Technical aspects

- Speed depends on the source internet connection(s)
- Can combine multiple internet sources for increased bandwidth
- Future compatibility with existing node runner hardware
- Supports VPN integration
- Open-source solution without a moat

## Current status

- Project is in development
- New architecture being implemented
- Working demos achieved
- Aiming for broader user on-boarding
- Documentation is being updated
